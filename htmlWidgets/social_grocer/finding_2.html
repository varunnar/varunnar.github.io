<h3>Finding 2: Price</h3>
<div>
    <div>
        <p><b>Most participants primarily looked at images & price, which allowed them to shop efficiently, but often without careful consideration of the items they’ve purchased.</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><P>Most participants frequently did not examine product pages beyond glancing at the title and  images.</P></li>
            <li><p>Price was particularly important to all participants’ purchasing decisions, often posing as a deal breaker and prompting them to opt for the cheapest option without reviewing the quality or nutrition information</p></li>
