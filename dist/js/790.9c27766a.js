In response my answer is simple - I have no idea.</p></div>\n      <p>Now don't leave! I just am not really sure what this is yet. I have felt that I was blogger. Nor am I such a master of engineering that I suspect that you feel like you really need to come here to learn - at least not yet. I'm just a 26 year old guy trying to understand a volatile and confusing tech world. Things are changing so fast. In fact I doubt I fully comprehend how fast things are changing. And as AI breaks through and changes every single field and job title, I am just trying to document my experience with it. Whether thousands of people read this, or it's just me looking back on myself, I want to try and capture my understanding of it. In all honestly this blog exists for 3 reasons.</p>\n         <h3>1. I want to keep a documentation of my projects, thoughts and journeys</h3>\n         <p>as not only an engineer and a designer,\n             I know one of the most important part of having a good case study is documenting it. I am famously awful at this - so this blog serves as an excuse to constantly take pictures, screenshots and to explain my process</p>\n          <h3>2. I want to make an impact on my community that is truly human</h3><p>In a world that is so tech oriented, with A.I. bots writing the essays of high schoolers around the globe, I want to contribute more than just skills - \n            I want to contribute my personality, my terrible jokes and more. Again nobody might read this - but if you are still reading I hope that what my blogs say reminds you that behind the tech mask our society wears we're all just a bunch\n             of human nerds trying to figure it out (and if you aren't a nerd shame on you! Find something to nerd about it's fun!)</p>\n          <h3>I don't have a job and this is kind of fun</h3>\n          <p>Okay now I know you definitely jumped off! But it's true! I am currently in an incredibly rough job market,\n             and doing projects like this provides structure to my day. Sue me for wanting to do something creative and fun after 250 apps.</p>\n        <img src=\"example.jpg\" alt=\"Example image\">"]}]);return(t,n)=>((0,o.uX)(),(0,o.CE)("div",l,[((0,o.uX)(!0),(0,o.CE)(o.FK,null,(0,o.pI)(e.value,(t=>((0,o.uX)(),(0,o.Wv)(u,{key:t.id,title:t.title,content:t.content,id:t.id},null,8,["title","content","id"])))),128))]))}};const c=(0,i.A)(h,[["__scopeId","data-v-d6a30560"]]);var y=c}}]);
