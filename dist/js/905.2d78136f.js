Nor am I such a master of engineering that I suspect that you feel like you really need to come here to learn - at least not yet. I'm just a 26 year old guy trying to understand a volatile and confusing tech world. Things are changing so fast. In fact I doubt I fully comprehend how fast things are changing. And as AI breaks through and changes every single field and job title, I am just trying to document my experience with it. Whether thousands of people read this, or it's just me looking back on myself, I want to try and capture my understanding of it. In all honestly this blog exists for 3 reasons.</p>","<h2>My Goals</h2><h4>1. I want to keep a documentation of my projects, thoughts and journeys</h4>\n      <p>as not only an engineer and a designer,\n          I know one of the most important part of having a good case study is documenting it. I am famously awful at this - so this blog serves as an excuse to constantly take pictures, screenshots and to explain my process</p>\n       <h4>2. I want to make an impact on my community that is truly human</h4><p>In a world that is so tech oriented, with A.I. bots writing the essays of high schoolers around the globe, I want to contribute more than just skills - \n         I want to contribute my personality, my terrible jokes and more. Again nobody might read this - but if you are still reading I hope that what my blogs say reminds you that behind the tech mask our society wears we're all just a bunch\n          of human nerds trying to figure it out (and if you aren't a nerd shame on you! Find something to nerd about it's fun!)</p>\n       <hr/>\n          <h4>3. I don't have a job and this is kind of fun</h4>\n       <p>Okay now I know you definitely jumped off! But it's true! I am currently in an incredibly rough job market,\n          and doing projects like this provides structure to my day.

Since doing that my focus has moved to a new endeavor - the intersection of AI and education</p>","<h2>What do I think on AI in general?</h2><p>In general, I'm like most people with AI - really on the fence. I see its power and ability - tools like Cursor have changed how I approach coding completely. My developer brain loves the improved efficiency and speed - my designer human-centric brain is less gungho - especially with education. So, going into this space, I felt incredibly conflicted.</p>","<h2>The Current State of Education</h2><p>I have a pretty personal connection to the education space, with a high school math teacher mother is a math teacher, and previous experiences as both a private math tutor and a Mathnasium Inc. tutor. In both my tutoring experiences, I was faced with the impacts of quick and effective answer access for children and young adults. I sat with students in Calculus courses struggling with times tables, with students who couldn't understand the curriculum because Google and calculators had allowed them to barely pay attention to the foundations they needed. Many times, their reliance on the tools forced them to struggle even when they had access to them, because they didn't have enough experience with the mathematical topic to know when to apply it. And I unquestionably worry about this with AI.</p>","<h2>Efficiency vs. Learning</h2><p>Efficiency and learning struggle to coexist. Dr. Huberman of the Huberman podcast identifies this with his episode \"Optical Protocols for Studying and Learning.\" where he discusses that there isn't any shortcut to learning and that many times, failure to understand something is the best way to learn - helping to isolate on what you don't know forces you not only acknowledge it and activates your mind to learn it. But if we move down an efficiency model, we want the right answer, and we want it immediately, leaving little room for learning itself. Instead, students learn that they don't know too late, when they need to apply it. At the end of the day, we want to students to leave school as leaders, innovators, and more - well those things take a level of expertise in spaces that ALLOWs you to be creative. If an AI bot has let you copy and paste your answers, do you know it well enough to be creative?</p>","<h2>AI Tools - The Pros and Cons</h2>\n        <p>This space is by no means underexplored.
