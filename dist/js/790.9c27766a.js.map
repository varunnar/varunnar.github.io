In response my answer is simple - I have no idea.</p></div>\n      <p>Now don't leave! I just am not really sure what this is yet. I have felt that I was blogger. Nor am I such a master of engineering that I suspect that you feel like you really need to come here to learn - at least not yet. I'm just a 26 year old guy trying to understand a volatile and confusing tech world. Things are changing so fast. In fact I doubt I fully comprehend how fast things are changing. And as AI breaks through and changes every single field and job title, I am just trying to document my experience with it. Whether thousands of people read this, or it's just me looking back on myself, I want to try and capture my understanding of it. In all honestly this blog exists for 3 reasons.</p>\n         <h3>1. I want to keep a documentation of my projects, thoughts and journeys</h3>\n         <p>as not only an engineer and a designer,\n             I know one of the most important part of having a good case study is documenting it. I am famously awful at this - so this blog serves as an excuse to constantly take pictures, screenshots and to explain my process</p>\n          <h3>2. I want to make an impact on my community that is truly human</h3><p>In a world that is so tech oriented, with A.I. bots writing the essays of high schoolers around the globe, I want to contribute more than just skills - \n            I want to contribute my personality, my terrible jokes and more. Again nobody might read this - but if you are still reading I hope that what my blogs say reminds you that behind the tech mask our society wears we're all just a bunch\n             of human nerds trying to figure it out (and if you aren't a nerd shame on you! Find something to nerd about it's fun!)</p>\n          <h3>I don't have a job and this is kind of fun</h3>\n          <p>Okay now I know you definitely jumped off! But it's true! I am currently in an incredibly rough job market,\n             and doing projects like this provides structure to my day. Sue me for wanting to do something creative and fun after 250 apps.</p>\n        <img src=\"example.jpg\" alt=\"Example image\">`,\n    ], }]);\n  </script>\n  \n  <style scoped>\n  .blog-post-list {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    gap: 2rem;\n  }\n  </style>","import script from \"./blogPostList.vue?vue&type=script&setup=true&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./blogPostList.vue?vue&type=script&setup=true&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./blogPostList.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=d6a30560&scoped=true&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['__scopeId',\"data-v-d6a30560\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["__exports__","posts","ref","id","title","content"],"sourceRoot":""}
