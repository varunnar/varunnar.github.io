<h3 class="finding">Finding 3: Social Media</h3>
<p><b>Social media is an influential force in most participants’ purchasing decisions, enticing them to buy personally novel items as they trust online recommendations, but often without further investigation.</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Participants like the experience of trying new things to the point that they will directly search for online recommendations that will tell them what to try next. </p></li>
<li><p>The visual information provided online was sticky enough that participants had a mental image of it later when in the store.</p></li>
</ul>
