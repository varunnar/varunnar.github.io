                <p>With this proposal, we aimed to better understand the online grocery shopping space, starting with initial desk research.</p>
                <!-- <h2>Research Process</h2>
                <p>With limited instructions, and a broad space to cover each of our members researched unique areas with a <b>literature review.</b> 
                    We also each reseached existing food/grocery delivery companies in a <b>competitive analysis.</b></p> -->
                <h2>Literature Review Research Areas</h2>
                <p>We conducted a literature review with 23 sources, focused on three areas: the impacts of solitary eating, 
                    the connections between mental health and grocery shopping, 
                    and how the online grocery experience differs from in-person shopping in relation to health.</p>

                <p>After completing our qualitative research we wanted to verify that these results persisted for a larger demographic and on a larger scale.</p>
                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>We surveyed young adults who shop for groceries online, designing questions based on our research goals. From nearly 1,000 responses, we filtered 108 participants matching our target demographics.</p>

                <p>After completing our quantitative data collection, I then was tasked in making sense of the wide arrange of data I had. I developed a number of visualizations, using the Javascript framework, <b>Vegalite</b>.</p>
                <h3>Static Visualizations</h3>
                <p>Below are included the key visualizations which helped to validate our project as we continued.</p>

                <p>Our project, <b>Social Grocer</b>, was born from the idea of making grocery shopping more social.
                    Research showed that while shopping is often solitary, people value friend recommendations. 
                    Social Grocer enables users to shop online with friends and family in real-time, promoting 
                    mindfulness and accountability through healthy food suggestions and a cart health score. 
                    This score can be shared online to celebrat e nutrition-focused progress.</p>
